# Hi, I'm Pranav Srinivas Venkatesh👋

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a collection of all the **Data Science** and **Data Analysis** projects I’ve completed for academic, self-study, and personal growth.

This portfolio also showcases my **achievements**, **technical skills**, and **certifications** in the data domain.  
It is **updated regularly** as I continue learning and building impactful projects.

      This project builds a multi-level hybrid blog recommendation system using a combination of popularity-based, content-based, collaborative filtering approaches. It is based on three main datasets: author information, blog metadata, and user-blog interaction (ratings).
