# Hi, I'm Pranav Srinivas Venkatesh👋

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a collection of all the **Data Science** and **Data Analysis** projects I’ve completed for academic, self-study, and personal growth.

This portfolio also showcases my **achievements**, **technical skills**, and **certifications** in the data domain.  
It is **updated regularly** as I continue learning and building impactful projects.

Feel free to explore, connect, or collaborate!

      This project builds a multi-level hybrid blog recommendation system using a combination of popularity-based, content-based, collaborative filtering approaches. It is based on three main datasets: author information, blog metadata, and user-blog interaction (ratings).

      MedBuddy is a conversational medical assistant built with LangChain, Streamlit, and LLMs (Zephyr/Ollama). It helps users interactively explore drug-related information, compare medications, understand medical terms, and even suggest drugs based on symptoms.

      <a href="https://github.com/pranavsrinivas29/MedBuddy_chatbot"><b>Unreasonable-effectiveness-of-RNN</b></a><br/>
      In this project, I explored three use cases where RNNs act as character-level language models.
      First, the RNN is trained on Shakespeare’s dialogues to generate English-like text. Then, it's used to create new baby names based on a dataset of existing ones. Finally, it generates LaTeX code from a set of sample inputs.

      This project focuses on predicting customer churn based on their telecom service usage and profile attributes. The goal is to explore feature importance, address class imbalance via algorithm-level methods (not resampling), and compare classifier performance.
